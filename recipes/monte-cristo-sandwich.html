    <p>Monte Cristo Sandwich is piled high with ham, turkey, cheese, and three slices of honey 
        wheat bread that is dipped in batter and deep-fried to a golden brown.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sandwich</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9 slices honey wheat bread</li>
        <li>9 slices roasted turkey, deli meat - we prefer a thick cut</li>
        <li>9 slices honey ham, deli meat - we prefer a thick cut</li>
        <li>3 slices mild cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>3 slices Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Batter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
        <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>red raspberry preserves, for dipping</li>
        <li>honey mustard, (optional) for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Sandwich</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Assemble sandwiches on a work surface. Start with one slice of bread, three slices of turkey, 
            1 slice of Swiss cheese, another slice of bread, three slices of ham, 1 slice of cheddar cheese and one final slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Slice the sandwich diagonally and then wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill for 2-3 hours 
            (up to overnight). Chilling allows the sandwich to firm up which will help it hold together in the frying process.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Batter</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>After chilling the sandwiches, make the batter*.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl combine water and egg, whisking to combine. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and whisk well until 
            all ingredients are incorporated and the batter is smooth. Set aside while you heat the oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Frying the Sandwiches</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour about 2 inches (or more) of oil into a large pot (enough to cover the sandwich) and set it over medium heat. Heat the oil to a 
            temperature between 325°F-350°F.</li>
        <li>Working one half a sandwich at a time, remove the plastic wrap from the chilled sandwich and dip it into the batter with your hands. 
            Then, use metal tongs to dip the sandwich into the hot oil. You may have to hold down the sandwich to submerge in oil or flip it. Fry until 
            golden brown (4-5 minutes with homemade batter or closer to 4 minutes with pancake batter ). Remove from the oil and set on a paper towel-lined 
            plate to drain slightly. Repeat with the remaining halves.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the fried sandwich lightly with confectioners' sugar and serve with a side of raspberry preserves for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
